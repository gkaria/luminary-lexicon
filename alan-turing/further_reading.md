### The Most Human Human by Brian Christian (2011)
Account of the author's experience competing in the Loebner Prize (a Turing Test competition) with reflections on what it means to be human.

**Why read it:** Modern exploration of Turing's ideas about machine intelligence.

## On His Legacy and Impact

### Alan M. Turing by Sara Turing (1959, reprinted 2012)
Biography written by Turing's mother, providing personal insights into his childhood and character.

**Why read it:** Intimate portrait from someone who knew him best, though it omits discussion of his homosexuality.

### Professor Alan Turing Decoded by Dermot Turing (2015)
Another book by Turing's nephew, focusing on lesser-known aspects of his work and life.

**Why read it:** Details not found in other biographies, written by a family member with access to private papers.

### Turing: Pioneer of the Information Age by B. Jack Copeland (2012)
Concise biography focusing on Turing's pioneering role in computing.

**Why read it:** Shorter than Hodges' biography, focuses specifically on his computational contributions.

## Films and Documentaries

### The Imitation Game (2014)
Feature film starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing. While it takes dramatic liberties, it brought Turing's story to mainstream audiences.

**Why watch:** Accessible introduction, though you should fact-check afterward.

### Codebreaker (2011)
Documentary narrated by Derek Jacobi, combining biography with examination of Turing's ideas.

**Why watch:** More historically accurate than The Imitation Game.
