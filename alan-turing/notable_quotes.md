## One of Alan Turing’s most famous and widely quoted lines comes from his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence":

> Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s?

This quote captures his visionary thinking about learning systems, anticipating what we now call machine learning — the idea that machines can learn and develop over time, much like a child does.

## Another widely attributed (though apocryphal) quote often linked to Turing's legacy is:

> We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.

This was actually from the conclusion of a 1950 lecture, and it beautifully reflects Turing’s humble acknowledgment of the complexity of AI and the long journey ahead.
