    <h1>Steve Jobs: The Intersection of Technology and Liberal Arts</h1>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>Design is How It Works</h2>
      <p>Jobs transformed how we think about design in technology. For him, design wasn't just about aesthetics—it was about how something worked. He believed that simplicity was the ultimate sophistication. This philosophy led to products that were intuitive, elegant, and powerful—from the original Macintosh to the iPhone.</p>
      <blockquote>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>Focus and Saying No</h2>
      <p>One of Jobs' most important leadership principles was focus. When he returned to Apple in 1997, the company was producing dozens of products. He cut the product line down to just four computers. This ruthless prioritization allowed Apple to pour all its resources into making a few products insanely great rather than spreading itself thin.</p>
      <blockquote>"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas."</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>The Reality Distortion Field</h2>
      <p>Jobs was known for his "reality distortion field"—the ability to convince himself and others that anything was possible. While sometimes frustrating for his team, this trait pushed people to achieve what they thought was impossible. The first Macintosh, the iPhone, and the iPad all began as "impossible" projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>Connecting the Dots</h2>
      <p>Jobs believed that creativity came from connecting diverse experiences. His calligraphy class at Reed College later influenced the beautiful typography on the Mac. His study of Zen Buddhism influenced Apple's minimalist design philosophy.</p>
      <blockquote>"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>Impact on Multiple Industries</h2>
      <p>Jobs didn't just improve existing products—he transformed entire industries:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Computing:</strong> Made computers accessible and beautiful (Apple II, Macintosh)</li>
        <li><strong>Animated Films:</strong> Revolutionized animation with Pixar (Toy Story)</li>
        <li><strong>Music Industry:</strong> Changed how we buy and listen to music (iPod, iTunes)</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Phones:</strong> Redefined what a phone could be (iPhone)</li>
        <li><strong>Tablets:</strong> Created an entirely new product category (iPad)</li>
        <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Reimagined how technology is sold (Apple Stores)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>Notable Quotes</h2>
      <blockquote>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Stay hungry, stay foolish."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"It's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing."</blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="card-section">
      <h2>The Legacy: Think Different</h2>
      <p>Jobs' greatest gift was showing that technology companies could value design, user experience, and the humanities just as much as engineering prowess. He proved that the intersection of art and science could create products that changed the world. His "Think Different" campaign wasn't just marketing—it was his personal philosophy: honor the rebels, the misfits, the ones who see things differently. Because those are the people who change the world.</p>
